# compendium-navigator

This is an advanced filter to navigate all of your compendiums to select items for roll tables. 
Currently only supporting Actors and Items. Macros, Journal Entries, etc will be supported at a later date.

This is not quite yet ready for full production. Lots of refactoring is going to take place over the next couple weeks. Consider this a rough draft.
