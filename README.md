# compendium-navigator

This is an advanced filter to navigate all of your compendiums to select Actors or Items for roll tables. Currently only supporting Actors and Items. Macros, Journal Entries, etc will be supported at a later date.

This is a stable build, however, I have a lot of refactoring to do.  I'll put up a more comprehensive description of this module at a later date.
